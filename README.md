### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Ibukunoluwa, a Computer Engineering PhD student at the University of Southern California, Viterbi School of Engineering. I conduct research in the [Network Reconaissance Lab](https://netrecon.usc.edu/baker/research/) under the supervision of [Professor Corey Baker](https://netrecon.usc.edu/baker/).

### My current research is centered around Wireless Networks, especially when internet access is intermittent or non-existent, usually referred to as Opportunistic Networks. I'm exploring the intersection of Social networking in these opportunistic network scenarios. I have an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a decent background in Mobile development. I spent some time before graduate school working as a Software Engineer across finance, health and insurance sectors.
